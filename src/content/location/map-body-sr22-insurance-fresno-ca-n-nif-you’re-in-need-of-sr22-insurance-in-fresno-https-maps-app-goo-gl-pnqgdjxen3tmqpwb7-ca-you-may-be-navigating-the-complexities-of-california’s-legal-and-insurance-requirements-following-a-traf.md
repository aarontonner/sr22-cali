### What is Fresno SR22 Insurance?

SR22 insurance is not a separate insurance policy but rather a certificate of financial responsibility filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). This certificate confirms that you meet the state’s minimum liability insurance requirements, which are:

* $15,000 for bodily injury or death per person
* $30,000 for bodily injury or death per accident
* $5,000 for property damage

The purpose of Fresno SR22 insurance is to demonstrate that you are a financially responsible driver, particularly after incidents that categorize you as high-risk. Insurance companies file the SR22 form on your behalf, ensuring compliance with California’s laws.

## Who Needs SR22 Insurance in Fresno, CA?

Fresno, CA SR22 insurance is required for drivers who have been identified as high-risk due to certain violations or legal issues. Common reasons for needing SR22 insurance include:

* DUI or DWI Convictions: Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs often results in the need for SR22 insurance to reinstate your license.
* Driving Without Insurance: If you were caught driving without valid insurance, you may need an SR22 to prove compliance moving forward.
* Reckless Driving Charges: Serious traffic violations, such as reckless driving, can lead to an SR22 requirement.
* At-Fault Accidents: Being involved in an at-fault accident without proper insurance coverage often results in the need for SR22 insurance.
* Multiple Traffic Violations: Accumulating multiple moving violations within a short period can categorize you as a high-risk driver.
