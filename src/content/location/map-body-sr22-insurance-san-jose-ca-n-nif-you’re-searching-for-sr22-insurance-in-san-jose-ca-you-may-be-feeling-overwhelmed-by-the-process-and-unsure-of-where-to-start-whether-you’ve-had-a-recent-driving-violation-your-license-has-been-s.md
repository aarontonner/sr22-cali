### What is SR22 Insurance?

San Jose SR22 insurance is not a standalone policy but rather a certificate of financial responsibility. It is filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to provide proof that you carry the state’s required minimum liability insurance coverage. The purpose of an SR22 is to ensure that high-risk drivers remain compliant with California’s insurance laws.

In California, the state-mandated minimum liability coverage is as follows:

* $30,000 for bodily injury or death to more than one person

If you’re required to obtain SR22 insurance, it means the DMV or a court has classified you as a high-risk driver, and you must demonstrate financial responsibility to reinstate or maintain your driving privileges.

## **Who Needs SR22 Insurance in San Jose, CA?**

SR22 insurance is typically required for drivers who have committed specific offenses or violations. You may need SR22 coverage for the following reasons:

* DUI or DWI Convictions: If you were caught driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you will likely need SR22 insurance San Jose, CA to reinstate your license after a DUI conviction. Additionally, a DUI conviction will make you ineligible for a good driver discount, further increasing your insurance premiums.
* Reckless Driving: A reckless driving charge indicates a disregard for road safety, which can lead to SR22 requirements.
* Driving Without Insurance: If you were caught driving without valid insurance coverage, an SR22 may be necessary to prove your compliance.
* At-Fault Accidents: If you were involved in an at-fault accident without insurance, the state might require SR22 to reinstate your driving privileges.
* Multiple Traffic Violations: Repeated traffic offenses can classify you as a high-risk driver, especially if you accumulate too many points on your driving record.
* License Suspension or Revocation: An SR22 is often required to reinstate a suspended or revoked driver’s license.

If you fall into any of these categories, our team can assist you in securing the proper SR22 insurance coverage to meet California’s requirements.
